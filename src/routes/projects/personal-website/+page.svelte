<h2 class="mx-4">That’s a crooked tree, we’ll send him to Washington. This is happy place; little squirrels live here and play.
    I think each of us, sometime in our life, has wanted to paint a picture.
    All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.
    Maybe in our world there lives a happy little tree over there. Don’t forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.
    I think each of us, sometime in our life, has wanted to paint a picture. We don’t need to set the sky on fire, a little glow will do just fine.
    There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Lets build some happy little trees.</h2>
